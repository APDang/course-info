####Course Description and Objectives
CIS 440 is the capstone course for the CIS undergraduate program.  Over the course of the next fifteen weeks, you and your classmates will work in self-organized project teams to complete IT/IS projects that deliver tangible business value to real businesses and organizations.  This course will require you to apply the whole range of skills you have acquired through earlier CIS coursework, internships and work experience, as well as new skills learned in this course.  Moreover, the capstone project will test your ability to find and learn new tools on the job.

Some of the important topics covered in this course include:

- Agile approaches to project management, including the Scrum method
- Scoping a project, documenting requirements and defining acceptance criteria
- Metrics and “information radiators” for empirical project management
- Best practices including eXtreme Programming (XP), version control w/ Git, and testing
- The DevOps paradigm and tools such as continuous integration

An overarching objective of this course is that you and your team will improve your communication and organizing skills as you learn from (brutal) experience how to work as a self-organizing team and engage with a real client to complete a project with limited time and resources.  You will undoubtedly experience miscommunications, unpredictably changing requirements, and a host of other challenges, and will learn to overcome them.

This course is the capstone of your CIS degree program and you are expected to put forth a great deal of effort.  You will need to dedicate a significant amount of outside time for homework, project work, and meetings with your team and your clients.

####Email/Online Communication 
One of my jobs is to help you deal with obstacles and get the resources or help you need to succeed in this projects, so I encourage you to stay in communication with me.  When e-mailing me, please indicate in the subject line that it is for CIS 440 and which section you are in.  Be sure to sign it with your full name, and state your problem clearly.  You can expect me to check my e-mail at the beginning and end of the work day, but not necessarily on weekends or at night.  If you think you’ll need urgent help outside of the work week, let me know in advance.


####Examinations 
There is one final exam at the end of the course:
- CIS Critical Skills Assessment:  There are several skills that are critical and foundational to the discipline of Information Systems and the practices of systems analysis and design, and mastery of these skills is our expectation for anyone possessing a degree certifying completion of a BS in Computer Information Systems from the W.P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University.  To assure mastery of these skills, students will be given a skills assessment exam wherein they are presented with a business case study and expected to answer a series of questions that assess their level of competence with:
- - Identification of business information systems requirements and proposal of appropriate information systems solutions.
- - Using established methodologies for analysis and design of proposed solutions.
- - Selecting an appropriate project management methodology, explaining the critical issues and uncertainties that will determine project success, and communicating these issues in business terms.
NOTE: This material is not an exam based only on CIS440 material, but instead is meant to evaluate the skills you have learned from the entire CIS undergraduate program.  You may bring any books or other references that you wish.
	
####Group Policies 
You will form groups of four to six members for the course project.  When forming groups it is strongly recommended that you communicate frankly about expectations and identify any potential problems early on.  Do not wait until the end of the semester to ask for help with a teammate issue!  

####If You Are Kicked Off A Project Team
A student may be kicked off a project team if the client insists, or if the other teammates unanimously agree that he/she is either disruptive or not contributing to the work, subject to my agreement.  This it is important to be professional when dealing with the client and to make sure you are working well with your teammates.  If a student is kicked off his team, I may (at my discretion) propose an alternative project for the student to be able to complete the course.  It will likely be difficult and the grading will be subjective, so I strongly recommend not getting into this situation.

####Class Attendance and Participation 
Class attendance is necessary to achieve the maximum benefit from this class. You are expected to attend every class. Excessive absences will affect a student’s course grade and/or result in removal from the course.  If a student is unable to attend class for any reason, they should notify the instructor and their teammates as soon as possible by email.

####Academic Integrity  
From the ASU General Catalog:  “The highest standards of academic integrity are expected of all students. Failure to meet these standards may result in suspension or expulsion from the university and other sanctions as specified in the academic integrity policies of the individual colleges.”  By law and regulation, this course will be conducted within the ethical standards of ASU at large, which preclude such activities as plagiarism, cheating, and various forms of harassment.  Statement/policy on these issues:    http://provost.asu.edu/academicintegrity

####Students with Disabilities
If you wish to request accommodation for a disability, you need to be registered with the Disability Resource Center (DRC) and provide documentation from the DRC.

####Threatening or Disruptive Behavior
We will follow the ASU Student Services Manual (SSM 104-02) if there are any cases of disruptive, threatening, or violent behavior that arise.  Individuals can be asked to leave the premises or the police may be called in an extreme situation.

####Classroom Etiquette, Professionalism and the Learning Environment
It is an extremely high priority of your instructor that the classroom experience be one that promotes a learning environment for all students present. Students, taxpayers and many other University stakeholders have paid of their money, time and resources to make this classroom environment available to you. There are a variety of behaviors which are violations of classroom etiquette because they (1) distract other students, (2) distract the instructor, and (3) distract the student exhibiting the behavior. In order to assure an environment that promotes learning for everyone present the following behaviors will absolutely not be tolerated:

1. Using your laptop (surfing the web) for anything other than class business.
2. Talking during inappropriate times.
3. Showing up late for class.
4. Doing homework for another class during the normally scheduled class time.
5. Listening and/or viewing audio/video devices during class.

Each instance where a student is found to be in violation of classroom etiquette will cost that student 1% off the total 100% available for the class score. There is no limit to the number of percentage points a student may lose due to these violations.
