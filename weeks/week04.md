###Week 4

Stuff for Tuesday:

1. At 10:30 we will have a guest workshop by 29th Drive: (29thdrive.com) in MCRD 158.  If you are in the 10:30 section, you *must* attend.  If you are in the 1:30 section you are *strongly encouraged* to attend.
2. There will be no lecture at 1:30.  Students from either section may use the classroom (BAC 311) for team meetings + work.
3. Read a few pages in the textbook when you get around to it.  You should be up to pg. 136 about now.

Stuff for Thursday:

1. Our second demo day.  By now you must have some kind of working software that can be demonstrated.  So make sure you've put all the pieces together -- database, code, CSS, etc -- even if they don't have a lot of features yet.  The goal is to be able to turn it on so that we can give feedback and see what needs to be done next.
2. Commit v0.2 and tag it and push it to GitHub by midnight Thursday night.
3. If you are wondering about who the authors of your textbook are, watch the video at http://youtu.be/RgdF-j58yXE.
