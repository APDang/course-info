###Week 2

Stuff for Tuesday:

1. You should be up to page 64 in the textbook.
2. My lecture on Scrum should give you a little help in understanding "Where do we start?" and how to plan this thing.
3. If you haven't had a meeting with your client outside of class, you should make sure you have one ASAP.

Stuff for Thursday:

1. For the first "demo day", you're really just introducing your project to the rest of the class, showing us how you're getting started, and we will all try to give feedback on how you can proceed from there.
2. The videos at http://www.scrumtrainingseries.com are very good.  The "backlog grooming" video will help you in working with your client on what they want done.  The "sprint review" video will help you get the most out of a demo day.
