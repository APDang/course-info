###Week 1

Stuff for Tuesday:

1. We'll have the clients in and you'll form teams.
2. You should be up to about page 50 in the textbook.

Stuff for Thursday:

1. I will ask you "Which project are you on?" and you should know.  If we need to make adjustments because somebody didn't find a team Tuesday, or a team has too many members (you're allowed 4-6), we'll do that at the start of class.
2. Do the Git tutorial at http://try.github.io. Read the article at http://tinyurl.com/39hd87l.
3. Install Git.
4. Make sure you have an account on GitHub.com.  I will ask you for your account name.
5. Bring your laptop to class.
