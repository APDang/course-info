**Release 0.1 (due 9/4)**

For the first release, you need to work out the kinks of using Git and GitHub, and develop a README file which represents what you've learned from the first meeting(s) with your client, and prepare a "demonstrateable" scaffolding for your project.  The README file should contain at least three sections:

- Overview: a brief "elevator pitch" about what you're doing and why
- Team: a list of your names and github account names.  You can include clients, too.
- TO-DO: a to-do list or "product backlog" (see *The Elements of Scrum*, pp. 99-100); don't worry about how long it is, but try to get a sense of the client's priorities and make sure first things are first

You will give a demo in class on 9/4.  This can be a wireframe web site, PPTs or diagrams, or something else, but you need to be able to share your progress with your teammates and get their feedback and suggestions.  You'll have 4-5 minutes plus a bit of time for questions.

The files for your demo should be committed to the GitHub repository I will create for your team -- master branch.  If you can't get that done before class, I'll help.
