###Release 0.1 (due 9/4)

For the first release, you need to work out the kinks of using Git and GitHub, and develop a README file which represents what you've learned from the first meeting(s) with your client, and prepare a "demonstrate-able" scaffolding for your project.  The README file should contain at least three sections:

- Overview: a brief "elevator pitch" about what you're doing and why
- Team: a list of your names and github account names.  You can include clients, too.
- TO-DO: a to-do list or "product backlog" (see *The Elements of Scrum*, pp. 99-100); don't worry about how long it is, but try to get a sense of the client's priorities and make sure first things are first

You will give a demo in class on 9/4.  This can be a wireframe web site, PPTs or diagrams, or something else, but you need to be able to share your progress with your teammates and get their feedback and suggestions.  You'll have 4-5 minutes plus a bit of time for questions.

The files for your demo should be committed to the GitHub repository I will create for your team -- master branch.  If you can't get that done before class, I'll help.

Grading criteria: good demo (1) + visible progress (1) + README (1) + files (1) + can take questions (1)

###Release 0.2 (due 9/18)

By the second release, I'm looking for demonstrate-able software.  If its a website, you should be able to fire it up in a browser and click around the links.  If it's a mobile app you should be able to show it working on an actual device or an emulator.  

Non-software projects (like digital marketing or data analysis) can be creative in how they demo what they've done, but it should be communicated well enough that you could present it to the client and he'd understand what he was seeing.

This release should be committed as v0.2 to the master branch of your repo.  I will not look at other branches, so you should follow a branching workflow that keeps intermediate changes out of `master`.  If you have things that aren't code, but are necessary to replicate the project, those should be in the GitHub repo as well.  I'm specifically thinking about databases here.  You can't commit the database, but you can commit a text file containing the CREATE TABLE and INSERT statements to re-create the database.  Come ask me for help if you need it.

Grading criteria:  good demo (1) + visible progress (2) + TO-DO updates (2)
